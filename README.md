# eco_dialer
Eco Dialer is a helper app for dialling service numbers used in the caribbean.
The idea for ecoDialer was born when the Developer Mr. Delbert Defoe fell victim to one of his local service provider's 
viscious auto plan renewal functions another time one too many.
He decided that enough was enough, and that as an app developer, he would create a tool to stop this company from basically stealing his and others' money.
ecoDialer has a repository of useful service numbers that individuals may find hard to remember or dial, but most importantly, ecoDialer will cancel auto-renewal on your behalf
if you choose the option while requesting a plan through the app.
The app is designed to be intuitive to learn, too easy to use, and carries absolutely no additional charges.
Once an individual starts to put plans and dial numbers with ecoDialer, going back to his/her plain old dialer app will feel like
going back to the stone ages.
